==================
This repository contains several small projects I used to teach myself new things.

Bash -- Contains a bash script for running updates on Drupal sites. May develop a more universal version later.

Haskell -- relearning Haskell through the 99 problems on haskell.org

Python -- a small script for normalizing some data. Not generalized

Python Gui -- Working to teach myself to make GUI's using Python (Tkinter)

More projects to come.
